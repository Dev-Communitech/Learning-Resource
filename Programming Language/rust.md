# RUST

Rust is a programming language designed for safety, concurrency, and performance. It is a statically-typed language, meaning that you must specify the type of a variable when you declare it, and this type cannot change later. Rust also has a strong emphasis on ownership and borrowing, which helps prevent null or dangling pointer references and allows for safe concurrency.

Some notable features of Rust include:

Zero-cost abstractions: You can write high-level code that is just as performant as low-level code.

Ownership and borrowing: Rust's ownership system allows you to write code that is free of null or dangling pointer references. The borrowing system allows you to safely share and use data in a concurrent environment.

Safe concurrency: Rust's ownership and borrowing rules, combined with its support for lightweight threads, make it easy to write concurrent code that is both correct and performant.

High-level abstractions: Rust has a number of features that make it easier to write code at a high level of abstraction, such as iterators, closures, and pattern matching.

Compatibility with C: You can call C code from Rust and vice versa, making it easy to integrate Rust code into a larger system.

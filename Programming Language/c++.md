# C++ 

C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of the C programming language. It is an object-oriented language, which means that it allows programmers to define data types in the form of classes and objects.

One of the main features of C++ is its support for object-oriented programming, which allows programmers to define classes that represent real-world objects and the functions that operate on them. This helps to make C++ code more modular and easier to maintain, as it allows developers to create reusable blocks of code that can be easily modified and extended.

C++ is also a statically-typed language, which means that variables must be declared with a specific type before they can be used in a program. This helps to prevent errors by ensuring that the type of a variable is known at compile-time, rather than at runtime.

In addition to its object-oriented and statically-typed features, C++ also has a number of other features that make it a popular choice for a wide range of programming tasks. These include support for procedural programming, a rich standard library, and low-level control over system resources.

C++ is widely used in a variety of contexts, including operating systems, web browsers, games, and scientific applications. It is also the primary language used in the development of the Linux kernel, and is commonly used in the development of other open-source software projects.

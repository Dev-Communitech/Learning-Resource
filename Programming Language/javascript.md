# javascript
JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity to web pages
It is a client-side scripting language, which means that the code is executed by the user's web browser rather than on a server. JavaScript can be used to create things like dropdown menus, pop-up windows, and interactive forms.
It can also be used to control multimedia, animate graphics, and perform other interactive tasks.

JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is characterized by its dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based nature. This means that it is flexible and can be used to create a wide variety of applications, but it can also be more difficult to debug and maintain than a strongly typed, class-based language like Java.

JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create web applications and dynamic web pages. It can be used to add interactivity to web pages, control multimedia, animate graphics, and perform other interactive tasks.

JavaScript is a popular choice for web development because it is widely supported by modern web browsers and can be used to create a wide variety of applications. It is also a good choice for beginners because it is relatively easy to learn and use.

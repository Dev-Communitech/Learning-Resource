# javascript
JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity to web pages
It is a client-side scripting language, which means that the code is executed by the user's web browser rather than on a server. JavaScript can be used to create things like dropdown menus, pop-up windows, and interactive forms.
It can also be used to control multimedia, animate graphics, and perform other interactive tasks.

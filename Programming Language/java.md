# Java
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is designed to be platform-independent, allowing programs to run on different systems without modification. Java is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile applications, video games, and other types of software.

# Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program written in Java:
```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
This program defines a class named Main with a main method, which is the entry point of the program. Inside the method, it calls the println method from the System.out object to print the string "Hello, World!" to the console. The main method is executed when the program runs.

Java is a mature and powerful language that offers a wide range of features, including object-oriented programming, automatic memory management, built-in support for multithreading, and a large class library. Java also has a large and active community, which provides a wealth of resources and libraries.

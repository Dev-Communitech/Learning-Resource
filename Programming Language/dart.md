# Dart

Dart is a programming language developed by Google. It is used to build web, mobile, desktop, and backend applications. One of the main goals of Dart is to provide a more productive way to develop web applications, while still being able to produce code that runs natively on the web.

Dart is a class-based, object-oriented language with a C-style syntax. It is dynamically-typed, meaning that you do not need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it. Instead, the type of a variable is determined at runtime.

# Here is a simple example of a Dart program that prints a message
```void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```
This program has a single function, main, which is the entry point of every Dart program. The main function contains a single line of code that uses the print function to print a string to the console.

# Here are a few more things you might find useful to know about Dart:

Asynchrony: Dart supports asynchronous programming through the use of async and await keywords. This makes it easy to write code that performs multiple tasks concurrently and avoids blocking the main thread.

Flutter: Flutter is a mobile app development framework built with Dart that allows you to build natively-compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

Web development: Dart can be used to build web applications that run in modern web browsers. It can also be used to build server-side applications that run on the server using a technology called Dart Web Server.

Tooling: Dart comes with a number of tools that make it easier to develop, test, and debug your applications. Some of these tools include a package manager, a test runner, and a debugger.

Interoperability with JavaScript: You can use Dart to write code that can be called from JavaScript and vice versa, making it easy to integrate Dart code into a larger web application.

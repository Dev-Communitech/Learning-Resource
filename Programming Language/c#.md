# C# (pronounced "C-sharp")

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is designed to be simple, safe, and powerful, and it is commonly used to build Windows desktop applications, Windows Store apps, web applications, and games. C# is part of the .NET ecosystem, which also includes the .NET Framework, an extensive library of pre-written code, and the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which manages the execution of .NET programs.

C# syntax is heavily influenced by C and C++, but it also incorporates elements from other languages such as Java and Delphi. C# supports features such as strong type checking, automatic memory management, and garbage collection. It also includes support for modern programming constructs like lambda expressions, generics, and async/await.

# Here is an example of a "Hello, World!" program written in C#:
```
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
This program defines a Main method that is the entry point of every C# program. The Console.WriteLine method is used to print a string to the console. The using directive is used to include the System namespace, which contains the Console class.

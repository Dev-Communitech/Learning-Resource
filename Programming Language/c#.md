# C# (pronounced "C-sharp")

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is designed to be simple, safe, and powerful, and it is commonly used to build Windows desktop applications, Windows Store apps, web applications, and games. C# is part of the .NET ecosystem, which also includes the .NET Framework, an extensive library of pre-written code, and the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which manages the execution of .NET programs.

C# syntax is heavily influenced by C and C++, but it also incorporates elements from other languages such as Java and Delphi. C# supports features such as strong type checking, automatic memory management, and garbage collection. It also includes support for modern programming constructs like lambda expressions, generics, and async/await.

# Swift
Swift is a programming language developed by Apple Inc. It is primarily used to develop applications for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. 
Swift is a statically-typed language, meaning that you must specify the type of a variable when you declare it, and this type cannot change later.
